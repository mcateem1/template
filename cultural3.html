<h3>Background Analysis</h3>
			<p>The name of the song is How to Save a Life by The Fray. The song is trying to get the point across that people need to pay more attention to people that are depressed, especially people at such a young age.  
The author sings about an adult at a summer camp who notices a kid is acting different than he usually does (Wiki). He is rejecting social activity and has been hanging by himself a lot and that is not like him. The adult tries to comfort the kid but is not sure on what to do. The young kid eventually gets into drugs and commits suicide because of his depression.
 The song writer sings of how he could have saved him if only he knew how to do it (Wiki). It contributes to the issue by an effort to make people aware of this underrated problem in society. Also, to help urge people that see this happening in the real world to take action and not stand by while something like this happens.
 It also could help people that are going through what the young kid went through and maybe urge them to steer in a different direction and get help. The main focus and message of the song and music video is to show people that depression is something that needs to be dealt with.</p>
