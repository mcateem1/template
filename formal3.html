<h3>Research</h3>
			<p>Mechanical engineers are also involved in a lot of research. It is a key part of engineering because an engineer’s work is most often based on research done. Research is essential in this field because technology is always changing. The moment something is produced it is already being analyzed on how to make it better. Research is important in the advancing of technology and also in testing to see how technology works and if it will hold up for its intended purpose. It is needed for technology to be observed and to be evaluated to make sure no changes need to be done. It is also important in comparing two different pieces of technology. Using the knowledge mechanical engineers gain from research they can improve the technology we use today. Many different objects are tested in a lab or in the real world to see what types of problems can happen. Often certain mechanical pieces are put to the ultimate test just so engineers can research the point at which an object will break or cease to function. For example, when they do research on cars they can analyze data and make improvements on things like fuel consumption, engine output, crash safety, emissions, etc.</p>
<p>The following graph is displaying the type of statistics an engineer might gather from doing research and analyzing data:</p>

<p>Using the data from this test, an engineer could conclude a number of things. After analyzing all of the emissions from various different types of engines, they can figure out which engines are producing the most toxic waste into the environment. Using this type of graphical display an engineer could show his findings and statistics to a group of other engineers and they could share opinions on how to improve it. From that point they can find out what they can change to the engine in order to reduce bad emissions that hurt the environment. This can help with the performance of the engine and also the effect it has on the environment.</p>
