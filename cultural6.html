<h3>Conclusion</h3>

			<p>In conclusion, I think that with the implementation of a few programs and mostly just the informing of people that the amount of victims of depression can be drastically reduced. With so many people suffering from depression every day, I think it is not something that should be kept a secret. Everyone should come together and put some sort of organized and structured group together. If more people started to recognize the problem then it would cause a chain reaction and people would follow the lead. Also, that people shouldn’t be afraid to help. They should use the advice that is out there and the advice in the song on how to help someone with depression. I think that is what this song is trying to implement. It is trying to inform people in a creative way to learn what they can do to help someone in a similar situation as the kid in the song. Also, I believe that people can make a bigger impact then they think they can. They get discouraged and think as one person they cannot make a difference. It is essential that this attitude changes and I think the writing and playing of this song is a small step in the right direction.</p>
