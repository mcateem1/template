			<h1>Cultural Analysis Paper</h1>
<h3>Statistics and Proposed Solution</h3>
			<p>Depression affects 1 in 10 Americans at some point or another (Healthline Networks Inc.). It affects many people from very young to very old. Many people resort to drugs in order to help themselves get through depression. Sometimes it becomes so bad and becomes so much of a burden that people will take their own life just as the kid in the song did. Also, many young people are getting into drugs and using them to help with their depression but end up hurting themselves even more. It is truly a sad situation and it is not as rare of an occurrence as people may think. In fact, suicide due to depression takes the lives of nearly 30,000 Americans every year (SAVE). That is twice as many deaths as HIV/AIDS and that is in the United States alone (SAVE). This issue is an issue that I feel has truly been neglected. Often times, the warning signs of depression are evident but no one wants to stand up and act on it. Many people don’t pay very close attention to it because they feel it is not that big of a problem. Another problem is that most people don’t know what to do when they encounter a situation like this. Often times, people don’t take others seriously when they say they have a problem like depression. This is one of the worst things to do because the person might not want to share what they are feeling ever again. They will bottle it up forever if no one believed them the first time they brought up the issue. Here are two verses from the song where the writer talks about his experiences and what to do if you encounter those experiences. The first verse states, </p>
<p>“Step one – you say, “We need to talk.”
He walks, you say, “Sit down. It’s just a talk.”
Your stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right 
As he goes left and you stay right 
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came”</p>

<p>In the next verse, after the chorus he continues his advice.</p>
<p>“Let him know that you know best
‘Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you’ve told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you”. (AZlyrics)</p>

<p>In those two verses, the author tries to inform people of things he did not do when it came to helping the boy at his summer camp. At the time he did not know but now how to help but now he is informing people of how. He talks about the importance of persistence when it comes to helping someone that is suffering from depression. You cannot back down and give up just because they say they don’t want to talk about it. It is saying that you should not give them any choice but to listen to you. Also, he is saying that you should lay down a list of what is wrong so that the person can recognize what is going on. The truth is that it is a much bigger issue than people think.  A lot of times it goes unnoticed because the person with depression won’t tell anyone until something bad happens. This is mostly due to the fact that people don’t want to admit to having a problem. They don’t want to be labeled and then have a stereotype put on them.</p>
