<h3>Construction and Planning</h3>
			<p>When a group of engineers come together to work on a project or the construction of something one of the most important things that go into it is the planning. The planning before the project begins can affect the success of the project and can also help minimize the cost of the project. The beginning stages of development are some of the most detrimental stages of a whole entire operation. They can affect whether the whole thing is a failure or a success. The engineering managers are mostly responsible for this planning and to oversee that everything is going accordingly and as planned. In the trade journal, Engineering Performance in the US Industrial Construction Sector, it speaks of these topics in depth. The abstract of the journal states: </p>
<p>“Industrial facility construction constitutes a major sector of the construction industry in the US. Even with the long history of building industrial facilities, it is not uncommon for industry professionals to encounter unanticipated cost overruns and schedule delays on projects. These experiences are leading the industry to become increasingly aware of the effects of a project’s early stages, particularly the engineering stage, on successful or unsuccessful implementation.”</p>
<p>It later states in another section of the journal:</p>
<p>“Over the last decade, there has been a growing realization of the influence, there has been a growing realization of the influence of a project’s early phases, e.g., pre-project planning and detailed design, on its successful implementation. As a result, many academic and professional institutes, such as the Construction Industry Institute (CII) and the Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering International (AACE International), have been active in studying the management of early project phases and how they generally influence the whole project cycle.”</p>
<p>These paragraphs are saying that cost effectiveness and planning have become two new components to engineering and construction. They are so important that they are changing curriculum in some institutes. It is a subject that needs to be taught to people going into the career of engineering. It is essential because no matter how much knowledge you have in your career, you will not be successful if you overrun your anticipated cost or do not meet deadlines because of poor planning. This diagram lays out the project development phases very well:</p>

<p>Project planning is a lot lengthier phase then someone may think. Most of the time, depending on the size of the project, it can take years to plan before the construction of the project even starts. Along with the planning is the engineering that goes on to make sure that every objects limits are accounted for and everything will work. If it is not accounted for then halfway through the project you could run into something that could completely ruin or throw off your plan for construction. This is why this is a long and thorough process that is highly underrated when people think about what goes into the construction of something. I think part of the reason it is so underrated is because it is not in a lot of institutions curriculum. This is why more and more institutions are introducing the planning into an engineering curriculum as stated in Engineering Performance in the US Industrial Construction Sector. </p>
