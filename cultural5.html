<h3>Proposed Solution cont'd and Anticipated Results</h3>
			<p>There is no way of completely resolving this issue but I think the best way to improve on this issue is to inform people. If we can find ways to inform people of this issue and stress the importance of doing something about it I think it is very possible to make a large impact in the number of people that choose to commit suicide over depression. 
A great way to do this is for more people to make more songs, movies, or videos on this issue. These artifacts can be very effective in the transfer of information to large amounts of people. Lots of people will see a video or hear a song about it and spread the word to other people they know. Not only will this spread the word but these artifacts can help them learn what to do in a certain situation. This will cause the spread of knowledge of the issue in order to create a wider understanding of depression and how it can be dealt with. 
Also, I think it would be great for a survivor or someone that has had bad experiences with depression to speak to others suffering from it. This would help them connect with someone who has or is still going through what they have and they can let them know that everything will be alright. Not only would this educate witnesses of depression but it also would get people with depression to learn that there is other ways out and that taking your own life is not the best route to go.</p>
