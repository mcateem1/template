<h3>Closing Question and Conclusion</h3>
<p>At the close of both of my interviews I asked the same question to each of interview subjects. At the end of my interview with Chuck Walters I asked, “What are the most important skills to have to be a successful engineer?” He thought for quite a while and then replied, “You have to have the ability to recognize information that is relevant to what you are trying to figure out and also what is irrelevant and can be thrown out.” He went to explain another important skill. He said, “You have to know how to communicate ideas over a wide range of audience. You may be conveying information to both technical and non-technical people and your vocabulary and type of talk will have to change to accommodate different types of people.” This was a skill that had never occurred to me before. It is a very important skill so that different types of people can understand your findings and recommendations. The end of my interview with Dr. Wolff had a different response. When I asked what skills were the most important Dr. Wolff said, “Organization. Organization and keeping track of what you need to do and when you need to do it. It is all about knowing what order to do things and how to optimize performance by doing things in a specific order.” He then went on to say that there is 4 key characteristics to have to be a successful engineer. He said, “There are two soft skills and two hard skills needed to be a successful engineer. The two soft skills are communication and organization. The two hard skills are technical knowledge and lifelong learning. Lifelong learning is the ability to keep on learning as you go on and to never plateau.” </p>
<p>In conclusion, from my research and from the interviews conducted I have found out a lot about engineering. It is important to be very well rounded if you are going to pursue a career in engineering. There is a lot of critical thinking, analysis, and soft skills such as communication and organization that lead to a successful engineer. Communication and writing are things that are underestimated in the field of engineering and it is important to stay on top of those skills to get ahead of the competition in the workplace. </p>
