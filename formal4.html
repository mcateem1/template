<h3>Communication</h3>
			<p>Another important aspect of engineer is communication. Most people don’t think a lot of communication goes on in engineering. Without communication engineering could not be effective. When engineers run tests or analyze something they communicate their findings to other engineers so it can be looked over and discussed. They usually display their findings in a few different ways such as graphs, tables, or spreadsheets. If someone is unable to read the certain types of graphs and various displays they won’t be able to understand the data and information that is being presented. They also will not be able to relay information or discuss things to improve with co-workers. Communication is also a huge part of international affairs in engineering. There is a lot of times when big corporate engineering companies will have to relay information and statistics to other engineering companies at an international level. This someone to be able to communicate in a different language or to have a translator that can relay between companies that speak different languages. Communication is essential to be a successful engineer and for an engineering company to be successful.  Here is a graph that gives a pretty good indication of the probability of needing to communicate at an international level.</p>

<p>This graph shows that there is a lot more people from different countries that are pursuing careers in engineering. This means you much more likely to have to deal with something at international level during your career. The importance of being able to deal with international affairs and being prepared for is on a rise. As read in the scholarly article, Engineering Education in a Global Context, there is a reference to the Executive Summary of the report, In Search of Global Engineering Excellence, which defines globalization very well through the following introductory statement: </p>
<p>“The world is rapidly transitioning from one nationally differentiated organizations and cultural identities to one increasingly characterized by transitional institutions and multicultural communities. Accelerated by dramatic technological advancements, this transformation is having a profound effect on national and international systems of commerce, education, and governance. This new world will require an even more sophisticated workforce to address the growing list of complex and interdependent global challenges, such as sustainability, security, and economic development. Engineers, whether working abroad or at home, play a critical role in addressing these and other global challenges.” (p.1)</p>
