<h3>Statement of Purpose and Description of Field</h3>
			<p>As I have gone through life, I have watched technology evolve. I have seen the new inventions, gadgets and updated technology implemented into our world to use. The question I always pondered to myself was who was responsible this new technology. I never knew what I wanted to be when I got older until I found out the answer to that question. At that moment, I knew I wanted to be a mechanical engineer.</p>
<p>Engineers apply scientific knowledge, mathematics, and ingenuity to develop solutions for technical problems. They define problems, conduct research, analyze solutions, test output, determine the causes of process failure and make decisions on how to correct something or improve something. Most engineering fields require an understanding of concepts such as mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, structural analysis, and electricity (Wiki). More specifically, mechanical engineers apply principles of engineering, physics and materials science to design, develop and maintain mechanical systems. Mechanical engineers work more with things such as vehicles, aircrafts, watercrafts, robotics, medical devices, and weapons. As opposed to civil engineers who work more with bridges, roads, and buildings; or chemical that work with processes that convert raw materials or chemicals into more useful and valuable products.  </p>
