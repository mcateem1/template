<h3>Technology</h3>
			<p>I would say that the most important aspect of engineering is technology. Technology is the building block of engineering. Technology is the reason engineers have jobs. The main reason why people engineer things is to make things better and more efficient which is essentially what the advancement of technology is. All fields of engineering use technology each and every day. New technology is being engineered 24/7. The field that uses the most technology in what they do is mechanical engineering. Even the things that are being engineered could possibly be built by a machine that was already engineered to make a certain piece of technology. In cases like these, technology is actually working on technology. In a mechanical engineering curriculum, students have to take a fairly rigorous amount of courses in math, chemistry, and physics. This is all to teach them how to apply those subjects when they get into higher courses which involve real world scenarios with technology. Mechanical engineers are responsible for things anywhere from aircrafts to ships and even to bike locks. It is incredible to think how much technology goes into a jet. Physics and math have to be applied into the engineering of a jet in order to make sure that it does not fail and that it is made so that it runs as efficient as possible. From the moment you start a degree in mechanical engineering until the moment you retire as a mechanical engineer you are going to be around technology. That is why technology plays such a huge role in any field of engineering. </p>
