			<h1>Course Retrospective</h1>
<p>Throughout the course of WRA 110: Writing Science and Technology there has been many different types of things that I have learned. It was a very different course then I expected it to be. There were many more aspects to it than just writing. I learned how to write in many different ways and how to incorporate research into my papers. I also learned how to create a website and how to customize and display my papers onto my website. Along with my website I gained my first experience with blogging. I gained experience with many new different websites and programs. I was introduced to Elireview, Github, and Codecademy. Using these websites and all of the other things I’ve learned will help me greatly in my future writing endeavors. </p>
<p>The class incorporated using many different types of writing. I was required to write a report while incorporating interviews and analyze different scholarly articles and trade publications. This taught me numerous things about how to research articles and how to incorporate them into my research papers. I also was required to write a report while analyzing a cultural artifact. I really liked the fact that we were required to use writing in different ways. It wasn’t just a boring paper where you just write to write. I got to write in fun and creative ways and I think that was something that really motivated me to do well and it helped me want to write in this class.</p>
<p>Writing my Lived Experiences Project was a great transition into the class. It was a paper that helped me ease into the writing mode and introduce me to the style of writing done in the class. It required me to relate my major to a specific piece of technology. This helped me prepare for the more in depth activities of relating things in the later assignments to come. Also, the online activity was a more basic edit to our website. This was perfect practice for the more challenging website edits as well. Pre-writing for this assignment gave me my first experience with Elireview. I think Elireview is a very positive tool and allows other people to give positive criticism of your draft/paper. The manner in which this paper was written was a perfect foreshadowing of what was expected in the next assignments.</p>
<p>For the next assignment, Cultural Analysis Proposal, I was expected to relate a cultural artifact to a social issue in the world today. This was something different then what I was used to. In high school, I had mostly only written persuasive papers or papers reflecting on a novel I had read in class. It made it more fun to write in a way that I had never written before. This assignment required a little extra online work for completion. It required functional tabs to switch from each section of the page to the next. The process of learning how to do this on Codecademy was very interesting. You get a great feeling of accomplishment when you create a link that works. This leads to the next paper which required many more different types of links.</p>
<p>Next, I was required to write a Formal Research Report. This report was the longest paper I was required to write for the class. It also required the most online work. I had to have numerous images and links on my webpage. Adding images to webpages require a different link and different characters and symbols in the html page to get this link to work. I had to refer back to my work done in Codecademy in order to get a refresher on how to do this correctly. This assignment also required two different interviews to be incorporated into the paper. This required some work outside of the classroom to set up interviews with two different people who have very busy lives. This brings me to my next point. This assignment was more than just a writing assignment. It gave me valuable communication experience. It allowed me to interview adults who are successful in the workforce and ask them questions that would benefit me for this assignment and in my future career.</p>
<p>The most fun project I did was the Multimodal Remix Project. In this project I got to work with a group of me and three others to form a documentary on one of the topics that one of us did a project about. We also could make a documentary on a similar topic to what we wrote about. This was a big refresher from writing papers and we got to create and edit a documentary that portrayed our point of few on a particular issue in today’s society. The issue my group chose was gun control in society. We had a lot of strong points on this topic but we wanted some of the opposition to show in our presentation. Therefore, we got to conduct interviews with other students across campus and get their points of view on our issue in society. In this part, we got a lot of mixed views from the issue of gun control and almost every person had something different to say about it. Then after gathering the information we had to find a way to piece it together. Then we decided to display it using a pretty interesting editing software to help make the video fun to watch. Then we got to use our skills we acquired from working through Codecademy and embed our video onto our website so that it can be played directly from the site. </p>
<p>The writing part for the most part was time consuming but it was fun. I got to write in many different creative ways instead of just writing long, mundane research papers that felt like they would never end. The assignments varied quite a bit which made it a lot more interesting that writing on the same basis over and over. I also liked how the assignments gradually incorporated more material learned on Codecademy. The using of different websites and adding little by little to each assignment made it seem as if assignments were not as difficult. Also, the Elireview website that was used for peer reviewing papers was very helpful and it allowed for other students to give you tips that can make your paper even better.</p>
<p>The online part, on the other hand, was probably one of the more difficult parts of the class to figure out. The coding of the website was really confusing at first. It took a lot of meticulous typing and paying very close attention to detail. Once I got used to it, I felt great satisfaction after completing an assignment and adding it to my website. I started out not working on Codecademy and I realized that adding to my website was very difficult. After I got deeper into Codecademy I started learning a lot more about coding and it became a lot easier to do my website. Another part I felt to be a little difficult was writing my blogs. This should not have been a more difficult part but I had decided to wait until the very end to write most of my blogs. This required a lot of thinking back to get topics to write about. One of the things I would recommend to someone taking this class would be to not make the same mistake I did and to do your blogs as you go through the coursework.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this class was a very unique learning experience. I learned how to write in useful ways that will allow me to communicate my ideas more effectively when I get to the work place. One thing I think I could have done better is stay more on top of everything. I needed to balance each aspect of the class and work on each part a little bit at a time. I found I would fall behind in Codecademy if I would focus too much on my papers. Then I would have to scramble to catch back up because something on my writing assignment required me to work through more Codecademy. Also, I think for the most part if you keep up with Codecademy and you pay attention to deadlines you will succeed in this class. Deadlines are very important because you only have class once a week. This means the professor isn’t reminding you every day of when things are due and you have to be on top of things and always checking the different websites and the syllabus. This class taught me many different ways to display information and my ideas and incorporate them into writing. It also taught me a few extra things that will be helpful at some point in my future. If you stay on top of the things I mentioned and do all your work this class can be a valuable acquirement to your knowledge for the future.</p>
