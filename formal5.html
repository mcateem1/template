<h3>Communication cont'd and Interviews</h3>
			<p>To get a better understanding of communication in engineering I interviewed Chuck Walters, a chemical engineer. I asked him a few questions regarding communication and writing in engineering. My first question was, “How is communication used in the career of engineering? Chuck replied, “Communication is used every day whether you are presenting ideas and results, or using data to support your recommendations on a specific topic.” He also said, “Engineering is a career where a lot of information needs to be gathered and conveyed. If you cannot do that then you won’t be a very effective engineer.” I then moved on to ask him, “How often is writing used to relay data or information in the field of engineering?” Chuck stated, “There is many different uses of writing. I use writing when replying to my daily emails, writing technical reports, equipment specifications and contracts.” “These are only a small amount of the things that require writing in the field of engineering”, he stated. These answers show that there is a lot of different ways communication is used in engineering and it displays how important of a role it plays.</p>
<p>I also interviewed an engineering faculty member at Michigan State University named Dr. Thomas Wolff. He is an Associate Professor for the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. I asked him a different series of questions more related towards education of engineering. My first question was, “Why is it important to be literate both technologically and rhetorically in the field of engineering?” He replied, “Communication is something that engineers have to use every day. Whether they are designing, comparing alternatives or talking about the pros and cons of something. Communication is very important. In fact, most of my promotions came from my ability to write and communicate effectively.” This statement really surprised me. I would have never thought a technically heavy career would admire strong communication and writing skills so much. The next question I asked was, “Most people believe engineering is all about being efficient in math, physics, and chemistry. What would you say is an underestimated component of engineering?” Dr. Wolff replied, “The most underestimated part, I would say, is in fact communication. A big part of that is translating the engineering part into others vocabulary so that it is easier to understand. The truth is, when you present data it is not just to engineers, but to a lot of different types of people. It is important that everyone can understand what you are talking about.</p>
