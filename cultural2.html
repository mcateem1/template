<h3>Description of the Issue</h3>
			<p>Depression is a rising problem in today’s society. It is endured by many people every day. 
It causes uncontrollable feelings in people such as sadness, anger, fatigue, and loss of interest in things that they use to be interested in. People often seclude themselves from public situations and it is often evident that something is on their mind. Depression itself isn’t even the worse part of it. The worst part is what it can cause people to do if it is not recognized and the person isn’t treated properly. 
The real issue is people becoming so depressed that they can no longer cope with it and resort to doing things that have some unfavorable outcomes. They don’t get the help they need in order to get through it and either take their own life or they start to use drugs. This song gives a first person point of view of an experience with the effects of depression and suicide/drug use due to depression. In the lyrics, it talks about an adult trying to confront a troubled teen that is depressed.
 He becomes too overwhelmed and eventually takes his own life. The song writer sings of his experiences and how it made him feel. In the chorus it talks about how he could not save him because he did not know how.</p>
