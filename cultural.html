			<h1>Cultural Analysis Paper</h1>
			<p>This report provides an analysis and evaluation of the current social issue of the effect of depression on people. It is displayed through an artifact of pop culture that is trying to send a message about the particular issue at hand. 
The artifact is a song that has a deeper meaning than just for the entertainment of people. In this essay, the song is interpreted and is explained on how it correlates to the social issue and what the meaning of the lyrics are.  Also, it evaluates the issue and how the lack of help from outside sources makes depression worse as well as how it can lead to suicide. 
It displays ways in which to improve this social issue and how to help solve the problem associated with depression.
 It also briefly states the anticipated results if the ways to improve the social issue were implemented.</p>

<p>Depression is a rising problem in today’s society. It is endured by many people every day. It causes uncontrollable feelings in people such as sadness, anger, fatigue, and loss of interest in things that they use to be interested in. People often seclude themselves from public situations and it is often evident that something is on their mind. Depression itself isn’t even the worse part of it. 
The worst part is what it can cause people to do if it is not recognized and the person isn’t treated properly. The real issue is people becoming so depressed that they can no longer cope with it and resort to doing things that have some unfavorable outcomes. They don’t get the help they need in order to get through it and either take their own life or they start to use drugs. This song gives a first person point of view of an experience with the effects of depression and suicide/drug use due to depression. In the lyrics, it talks about an adult trying to confront a troubled teen that is depressed. He becomes too overwhelmed and eventually takes his own life. 
The song writer sings of his experiences and how it made him feel. In the chorus it talks about how he could not save him because he did not know how.</p>
<p>The name of the song is How to Save a Life by The Fray. The song is trying to get the point across that people need to pay more attention to people that are depressed, especially people at such a young age.  The author sings about an adult at a summer camp who notices a kid is acting different than he usually does (Wiki). 
He is rejecting social activity and has been hanging by himself a lot and that is not like him. The adult tries to comfort the kid but is not sure on what to do. The young kid eventually gets into drugs and commits suicide because of his depression. The song writer sings of how he could have saved him if only he knew how to do it (Wiki). It contributes to the issue by an effort to make people aware of this underrated problem in society.
 Also, to help urge people that see this happening in the real world to take action and not stand by while something like this happens. It also could help people that are going through what the young kid went through and maybe urge them to steer in a different direction and get help. The main focus and message of the song and music video is to show people that depression is something that needs to be dealt with.</p>
<p>Depression affects 1 in 10 Americans at some point or another (Healthline Networks Inc.). It affects many people from very young to very old. Many people resort to drugs in order to help themselves get through depression. Sometimes it becomes so bad and becomes so much of a burden that people will take their own life just as the kid in the song did. Also, many young people are getting into drugs and using them to help with their depression but end up hurting themselves even more. It is truly a sad situation and it is not as rare of an occurrence as people may think. 
In fact, suicide due to depression takes the lives of nearly 30,000 Americans every year (SAVE). That is twice as many deaths as HIV/AIDS and that is in the United States alone (SAVE). This issue is an issue that I feel has truly been neglected. Often times, the warning signs of depression are evident but no one wants to stand up and act on it. Many people don’t pay very close attention to it because they feel it is not that big of a problem. Another problem is that most people don’t know what to do when they encounter a situation like this. There are two verses from the song where the writer tries to explain what to do. The first verse states, </p>
<p>“Step one – you say, “We need to talk.”
He walks, you say, “Sit down. It’s just a talk.”
Your stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right 
As he goes left and you stay right 
Between the lines of fear and blame
And you begin to wonder why you came”
</p>
<p>In the next verse, after the chorus he continues his advice.</p>
<p>“Let him know that you know best
‘Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you’ve told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you”
</p>
<p>The truth is that it is a much bigger issue than people think.  A lot of times it goes unnoticed because the person with depression won’t tell anyone until something bad happens. This is mostly due to the fact that people don’t want to admit to having a problem. They don’t want to be labeled and then have a stereotype put on them.</p>
<p>There is no way of completely resolving this issue but I think the best way to improve on this issue is to inform people. If we can find ways to inform people of this issue and stress the importance of doing something about it I think it is very possible to make a large impact in the number of people that choose to commit suicide over depression. 
A great way to do this is for more people to make more songs, movies, or videos on this issue. These artifacts can be very effective in the transfer of information to large amounts of people. Lots of people will see a video or hear a song about it and spread the word to other people they know. This will cause the spread or knowledge of the issue and help stress the importance. Also, I think it would be great for a survivor or someone that has had bad experiences with depression to speak to others suffering from it.
 This would help them connect with someone who has or is still going through what they have and they can let them know that everything will be alright. Not only would this educate witnesses of depression but it also would get people with depression to learn that there is other ways out and that taking your own life is not the best route to go.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I think that with the implementation of a few programs and mostly just the informing of people that the amount of victims of depression can be drastically reduced. With so many people suffering from depression every day, I think it is not something that should be kept a secret. Everyone should come together and put some sort of organized and structured group together. If more people started to recognize the problem then it would cause a chain reaction and people would follow the lead. I think that is what this song is trying to implement. 
It is trying to inform people in a creative way to learn what they can do to help someone in a similar situation as the kid in the song. Also, I believe that people can make a bigger impact then they think they can. They get discouraged and think as one person they cannot make a difference. It is essential that this attitude changes and I think the writing and playing of this song is a small step in the right direction.</p>
