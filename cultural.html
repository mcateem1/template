<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
			<p>This report provides an analysis and evaluation of the current social issue of the effect of depression on people. It is displayed through an artifact of pop culture that is trying to send a message about the particular issue at hand. 
The artifact is a song that has a deeper meaning than just for the entertainment of people. In this essay, the song is interpreted and is explained on how it correlates to the social issue and what the meaning of the lyrics are.  Also, it evaluates the issue and how the lack of help from outside sources makes depression worse as well as how it can lead to suicide. 
It displays ways in which to improve this social issue and how to help solve the problem associated with depression.
 It also briefly states the anticipated results if the ways to improve the social issue were implemented.</p>
