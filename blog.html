			<h1>It Gets Better Video</h1>
			<p>I watched a video on a Televangelist whose uncle killed himself because he was a gay man living in a Evangelical 
                          community. The man told a poem about how you should not kill yourself in that situation because you hurt everyone who has ever cared
about you. The structure of the message was a peom that flowed very well from one idea to the next. It told a story and it wasn't just stating boring facts. The structure of this story
will be very helpful in me adapting my Lived Experiences Project to fit the part. My rough draft was more of an essay and this message will help me change it into a 
better narrative. </p>
