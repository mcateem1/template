			<h1>It Gets Better Video</h1>
			<p>I watched a video on a Televangelist whose uncle killed himself because he was a gay man living in a Evangelical 
                          community. The man told a poem about how you    should not kill yourself in that situation because you hurt everyone who has ever cared
about you. The structure of the message was a peom that flowed very well from one idea to the next. It told a story and it wasn't just stating boring facts. The structure of this story
will be very helpful in me adapting my Lived Experiences Project to fit the part. My rough draft was more of an essay and this message will help me change it into a 
better narrative. </p>
<h1>The Social Network</h1>
<p>Technology has evolved to allow people to communicate freely and very quickly the press of a few buttons. They can write a story a novel or just chat with their friend across the globe without even picking up a paper or pencil. In the movie The Social Network it shows how one person uses the change in technology to take advantage of peoples interests in communication and writing in order to make a profit.
Mark Zuckerburg a student at Harvard created the website called Facebook. He created it so that people could social network online in a fun and creative way. He knew that people were interested in communicating with other people and always wanting to stay connected. He took advantage of that and created the website that would allow people to stay in the loop
without ever having to leave their house. He also found out what the main focus and reason of why people get on the internet and used it to his own advantage. Now that these social networking sights and communication technology is taking place over the internet. There is absolutely no need for writing letters anymore or even writing a book on paper. 
This change in technology is alreayd having a big impact and in another 20 years I think the impact will be even greater.  </p>
<h1>Classwork Entry</h1>
<p>In class we learned about the different view points on writing. It was a little confusing to understand. They are based off of the different types of career categories that all have a different view on the importance of writing in their field. After looking it over a little more I think it will
help me put together my formal research project.I found out that people in the science fields consider writing to not be as important as someone who is actual in a writing field or is a journalist. A person in a technical field might say the only use for writing is to get ideas across and to display information. A person who wants to be an author would probably have a completely different philosophy on writing. It would probably
have a much deeper meaning to them and it would have a much different message. It should form a good base and a nice viewpoint to go off from when writing about my career field.</p>
