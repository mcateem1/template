			<h1>It Gets Better Video</h1>
			<p>I watched a video on a Televangelist whose uncle killed himself because he was a gay man living in a Evangelical 
                          community. The man told a poem about how you    should not kill yourself in that situation because you hurt everyone who has ever cared
about you. The structure of the message was a peom that flowed very well from one idea to the next. It told a story and it wasn't just stating boring facts. The structure of this story
will be very helpful in me adapting my Lived Experiences Project to fit the part. My rough draft was more of an essay and this message will help me change it into a 
better narrative. </p>
<h1>The Social Network</h1>
<p>Technology has evolved to allow people to communicate freely and very quickly the press of a few buttons. They can write a story a novel or just chat with their friend across the globe without even picking up a paper or pencil. In the movie The Social Network it shows how one person uses the change in technology to take advantage of peoples interests in communication and writing in order to make a profit.
Mark Zuckerburg a student at Harvard created the website called Facebook. He created it so that people could social network online in a fun and creative way. He knew that people were interested in communicating with other people and always wanting to stay connected. He took advantage of that and created the website that would allow people to stay in the loop
without ever having to leave their house. He also found out what the main focus and reason of why people get on the internet and used it to his own advantage. Now that these social networking sights and communication technology is taking place over the internet. There is absolutely no need for writing letters anymore or even writing a book on paper. 
This change in technology is alreayd having a big impact and in another 20 years I think the impact will be even greater.  </p>
<h1>Classwork Entry #1</h1>
<p>In class we learned about the different view points on writing. It was a little confusing to understand. They are based off of the different types of career categories that all have a different view on the importance of writing in their field. After looking it over a little more I think it will
help me put together my formal research project.I found out that people in the science fields consider writing to not be as important as someone who is actual in a writing field or is a journalist. A person in a technical field might say the only use for writing is to get ideas across and to display information. A person who wants to be an author would probably have a completely different philosophy on writing. It would probably
have a much deeper meaning to them and it would have a much different message. It should form a good base and a nice viewpoint to go off from when writing about my career field.</p>
<h1>Chrysler Commercial with Eminem</h1>
<p>Today in class you we watched the Chrysler commercial advertising the new Chrysler 200. They used some very good points and ways of advertising the car. They used Eminem, the very successful rap music star, who was born and raised in Detroit and has used his success to help give back to the city. They also showed how Detroit is no known as a luxurious place and used the rhetorical question of, “What would the city of Detroit know about the finer things in life?” It then went on to show pictures of people working hard and talked about how Detroit has been through so much and hard work can make things special. This gets the viewers thinking that if anyone can build a great car it would be Detroit because of their work ethic.  After that, it cuts to an orchestra singing the beat to Eminem’s song, “Lose Yourself. Eminem then steps in front and talks about how this is Detroit and this is what we do. The closing line is referring to Detroit producing excellence both in cars and in a background meaning. The background meaning I think means that they produced excellence in both Eminem himself and in the orchestra behind him.</p>
<h1>Lived Experiencees</h1>
<p>My lived experiences project was a very interesting project to write about. I actually learned some new things about my career that I didn't know before. It allowed me to actually think to myself why I decided my specific career choice.
This was something I had never really done before. I had always known what engineering was but I realized when I started writing I wasn't really good at describing engineering. I had to describe it in a way in which other people could
understand what it was and what was it about. I also had to talk about how I was inspired to pursue a career in engineering and a specific event that made me sure that I was going to pursue an engineering career. I described how my 
interests had an effect on my career choice and how a piece of technology that I like is used in my career. My piece of technology was cars.  </p>
<h1>Cultural Analysis</h1>
<p>I have just finished my cultural analysis paper. I was expected to relate a cultural artifact to a social issue in the world today. This was something different then what I was used to. In high school, I had mostly only written persuasive papers or papers reflecting on a novel I had read in class. 
It made it more fun to write in a way that I had never written before. This assignment required a little extra online work for completion. It required functional tabs to switch from each section of the page to the next. The process of learning how to do this on Codecademy was very interesting. It was quite a pleasure to do this project considering that it was about such a sad topic. It also made me feel like a better person to write about a topic with such an important purpose.</p>
<h1>Classwork Entry #2</h1>
<p>In class today we had to research some articles online. It was very confusing at first. We had to find one scholarly article and one trade publication
on an article database. They had to be related to our intended career field and they had to describe or analyze a specific part of it. I chose a publication about international relations
in engineering. I chose it because I felt it related greatly to my chosen topic of communication in engineering. Communication is probably one of the most important things when you are 
dealing with international relations in engineering. I also chose an article on the preparing stages of the engineering process and I stressed the importance of planning before you 
start to construct a project. This is another important topic because planning can be the reason your project succeeds or if your project fails.
<h1>Formal Research Reflection</h1>
<p>I have just finished my research project. I am really proud of it because I put a lot of time into and it was my most difficult paper so far. It was hard because there was a lot of aspects that had to be incoorporated
into it. We had to conduct interviews with a person that practices our field and another person that teaches the field. The interview was not the hard part. The hard part was finding the right people to interview
and finding time in eachothers busy schedule to conduct an interview. Another difficult part was the fact that I had to incoporate many different images into my webversion. It was hard to remember how to do this specific act. I had to 
look back at my work in codecademy to see how to do this. Also, I had to research scholarly articles and trade publications that related to my intended career choice. I had to analyze and decompose these articles
and place them into my report. These articles provided very helpful material in understanding some different aspects of engineering. </p>
<h1>Multimedia Remix Project</h1>
<p>Today my group and I got a good start on our Multimedia Remix Project. At first we weren't quite sure how to start it. We want to make a video loop of many incidences where gun control was needed.
We also wanted to voice over our voices onto some of the video footage. This would give it an eery effect that would help us to get our point across. We are having some difficulties with the editing
software and so far that has been the most difficult part of this project. We have gotten a good jump on completing it but we will need to meet one more time to get our video to the time limit that we
need to meet for this projects requirements. This project has not been too bad so far. We got to work with groups which is something I like because you get ideas from around the group and from more than
one person. This makes it easier to get things done with more than one mind working on things.</p>
<h1>Codecademy</h1>
<p>I have finally finished Codecademy! The long hours of working through various sets of coding activities have finally came to a close. There was many times when I didnt think I was going to be able to finish
some of the coding activities because they had so many apsects to them. That made it difficult because you had to have every aspect right in order to move on to the next aspect. I had to click on the most frequently asked questions tab quite a bit 
in order to complete all of codecademy. I would get stuck on something and was very positive that I had the coding right. Therefore I would click on the questions tab and sure enough someone else would have had the same problem as me and it would 
give you tips about how to fix the problem. </p>
