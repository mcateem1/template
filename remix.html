    <h3>Remix Memo</h3>
<p>The issue we chose for our Remix Project had a big impact on the composing of the project. Since we chose the issue of gun control we knew we had to incorporate hard facts and we also had to show some footage as to why gun control is important. We also knew that we had to include the opposition and show opinions as to why some people are against gun control. While we gathered this information it helped me understand the issue better. Sometimes statements of the opposition helped me to understand more than statements of people for gun control. There were a few problems when organizing the project. It was hard to choose which factual information or ideas should go first and which should go last. We wanted to show things in an order that would make the most sense and also lead up to a climactic moment. This is where the audience comes in. We wanted to have a climactic moment which would invoke emotion in our audience. We thought that if we could get the audience emotionally involved in our project then that would make our side of the issue look even better.
</p>
<p>When we were first choosing topics we were back and forth between a few topics. We were thinking of writing on a specific career such as engineering or nursing. After thinking about that for a while we thought; how many people are going to want to listen to people talk about a career that might not even interest some people in the audience. That’s when we decided to choose a social issue. A social issue is something that everyone can relate to and would also keep the attention of the audience. This was a much better choice than a career but it still had some challenges in the composing the project. The most challenging part of the project was figuring out how to organize it. We found it difficult to organize while at the same time lining up a video the way we want with our editing software. We tried to take a very systematic approach but it just didn’t end up working out the way we planned. We had to modify and for the most part freelance our project in order to incorporate our info that we wanted to.
</p>
<p>We used a few didn’t resources to find our information. We found most of our information off the internet. The most beneficial information was found on websites that had proven statistics about what we were looking for. The least beneficial was probably the information we found about people using their opinions on the specific topic. The opinions were not helpful because they couldn’t persuade anyone because they weren’t always true they were just beliefs.
</p>
    <p>In order to complete this project on time our group took on different roles. We each had specific jobs to do whether it was compiling the video or looking for facts and information that could be displayed. I found working in groups for this project very helpful. It allowed us to all collaborate ideas and to combine our thoughts to make the best project we could. Having more than one mind working on it was much more beneficial rather than if we had to do it by ourselves.
</p>         
<p>For our planning process we did not spend too much time thinking about how we were going to do it. First we spent a lot of time gathering information and ideas. Then we thought about the most effective ways to place each of these ideas into a presentation. We did not want to waste too much time on the planning process. If we would have had more time we would have definitely spent more time on the planning process. This would have made the whole project run a lot smoother and it would of took less time to compile the presentation. Then we could have used that extra time to review and tweak to make everything even better.
</p>

<p>Even though we could have used more time we definitely got a few things that are very effective in getting our point across. The most effective aspect of our project was the fact that we used video editing software to loop video clips and use voice overs to help enhance and make our points more powerful. This will make our whole presentation flow much better and make it much easier to understand. It will also hold the audience’s attention longer. We made our design decisions based on the easiest way to present all of our data in an organized fashion. We realized we couldn’t display video footage if we used a video camera for our project so we had to use editing software so we could get video footage and slides with words on them. The editing software was the better overall choice.
