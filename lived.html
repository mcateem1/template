		<h1>Chasing My Passion</h1>
		<p>My whole life I have been asked what I want to be when I grow up. For most of my life I had no idea what to say to that question. 
One thing is for certain that from the time I was very little I had always been interested in cars. I was born into an automotive family in which my father and grandfather both worked for automobile companies as careers. As a young boy, I always loved playing with my toy cars and would race them across the carpet. 
I had a ton of hot wheels and I collected racecars. At a young age, I never really understood how much work went into building or designing cars. I was just very interested in them as an exciting object that was fun to play with. While most of the other kids were playing video games, all I wanted to do was just be around cars. It was not the typical interest of an elementary age kid. Little did I know that this would be the start of something that would affect my career decision. As I got older, my love for cars became more in depth and I started to learn a lot more about them. I began to appreciate all that went into them and how it was a long process to create a great car. I had no choice but to fall in love with cars because I was always around them. My father and I would always work together on cars and he would always teach me the things he knew. I would always say, “Hey dad can we go and work on the car?” Most of the time he would reply, “There is nothing to fix on it”. This upset me because I always wanted a reason to be around cars.  Even if my dad and I weren’t working on them we were watching NASCAR, or drag racing. It was the closest I could get to being around the real thing. I always knew that I wanted to find I career that allowed me to be around my love for cars.</p>
<p> Along with my interest in cars, I have always been interested in the advancement of technology. I have always appreciated how things were constantly being invented, updated, and changed to make our lives easier and more convenient. Tinkering with random objects is a hobby of mine. I always take things apart and put them back together, or I will try to see if I can improve the particular object. I have taken a particular liking to forms of transportation, especially cars. It is amazing how they can get you places so fast and so comfortably. As I went through high school I researched many careers that would allow me to be close to technology and possibly my passion of cars. I didn’t want to do something that I wouldn’t enjoy doing. I wanted to have a job where I could be excited to wake up in the morning and go to it. There are many careers I found which allowed me to do this. For example, a racecar driver, taxi driver, test driver, car salesman, car detailer, auto mechanic, crew chief, mechanical engineer, etc. Most of those careers are either unrealistic or wouldn’t make very great careers. I would love my career to be driving a racecar 200 mph around a track for a career, but that’s a long, winding road in order to be able to do that. Some of my fondest memories are buzzing around the yard in my go-cart and listening to the sound of the motor. I couldn’t imagine the adrenaline rush of something like a racecar. Although I did think long and hard about being a racecar driver, I realized it was probably an unrealistic career choice and not very many people can make a career out of it. After coming to that realization, I was a torn between few careers that interested me. For a while it was going to be a tough decision until one day it hit me. I was at an auto show, and I overheard a conversation between two older guys talking about the cars. They were talking about how the engineering in a particular vehicle was unbelievable. Also, how they were amazed at the things that were being done to cars to make them better and more appealing, and how they had been changed so much over the years. At that moment, I realized what I wanted to do. At that moment, I realized that engineers receive most of the credit for technological advancements. Everything we use today, for the most part, started on a piece of paper or a computer program with engineers looking at it. That was when I knew that mechanical engineering was the career for me. Mechanical engineering is a career that allows me to be able to work with technology and if I’m lucky working with automobiles.</p>
<p>Mechanical engineers are engineers that apply principles of physics and material science for the analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. I would be able use what I know, or what I what I will soon learn, to make certain piece of technology be more efficient or to engineer a new piece of technology in order to take the place of an old one. This is constantly happening in the automotive world and engineers are the main reasons behind the new advancements in fuel efficiency, power, design, cost efficiency, etc. When new cars come into production, engineers have tested the new parts and designs in order to create the best working machine possible. After I decided on engineering, I started to think of cars in a different way.  I would look at them and ask much more in depth questions then I used to. I would ask what is then engine displacement instead of how fast can it go. My understanding and views on them change the more I learn. Just thinking about myself working hands on with pieces of technology instead of at a desk with papers and files makes me so excited. That is, for sure, something I can see myself doing. It may not be as exciting as driving a racecar, but I would be the one responsible for the racecar. Also, engineers sometimes get to test what they have worked on or helped to build. That would be a dream job for me. Thinking about that makes engineering sound like a lot of fun, but not every engineer gets a job working with cars. When I sit down and think types of mechanical engineering jobs many things cross my mind. For instance, jobs working with things like aircraft carriers, children’s toys, wheelchairs, sailboats, hybrid car engines, and even bike locks. Someone might ask, “Why does a bike lock need an engineer?” The answer is there is many different components to even the simplest things that people take for granted. </p>
<p>There is something else that draws me to mechanical engineering. Something that I never really thought about at the beginning. The starting salary for a mechanical engineer is fairly high. Also, they have very high job security. Those are things that I like to hear. I don’t want a career that I can’t make a comfortable living off of. I also don’t want a career where I don’t know if I will be fired from one week to the next. Even when I look at all those aspects, I still feel my interest in cars and the technology involved in them was what drew me to pursuing a career in mechanical engineering. One of the best things about it is I can work and be doing something I love at the same time. This will make it so that I enjoy my job even more which will allow me to perform better in the workplace. Not only will I be helping to change the world, but I will still be able to be around my passion. It is not every day that you get to pursue a dream of yours. I hope that with some hard work and the drive from my passion I can make this dream become a reality.</p>
